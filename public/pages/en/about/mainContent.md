We are a diverse organizing team of students, PhD students and former students of ETH Zurich. We are passionately committed to the Discovery Semester. We want to give refugees an insight to studying at the ETH and the opportunity to build connections with students. Together with the mentors we accompany them in the study life, present academic and also professional perspectives and thus stand up for equal opportunities. For this purpose, we have created the Discovery Semester. We take care of organizing application procedures and registering mentees as listeners, finding and training mentors, organizing events, financing our project as well as networking with other organizations and much more!
