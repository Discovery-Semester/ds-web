### You want to support a refugee in getting to know ETH?
 
Refugees (mentees) can attend individual courses at ETH Zurich as listeners for one semester free of charge.

As a mentor, you can accompany a mentee from the same or a similar field of study together with another ETH Zurich student. You will support your mentee with all questions and concerns about studying at ETH. Your main tasks are:

- Support with the selection of lectures and the myStudies platform
- Help with orientation at ETH (campus, ETH facilities and services)
- Promote integration into student life (e.g. eating together, sports or social contacts)
- Participate in events where you can get to know other mentors and mentees 
- Provide assistance with mentees' questions 
- Give feedback about the program during and at the end of the semester
- Communicate with the organizational team regarding the mentee's well-being and their progress in the project
