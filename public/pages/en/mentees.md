  - Selection of lectures
  - ETH myStudies platform
  - Orientation at ETH (Campus, ETH facilities and services)
  - Integration into student life
  - Language skills (mostly German and English)
  - Other questions
- There are various events where you can meet other mentees and mentors and improve your language skills.
- At the end of the semester you will receive a certificate of participation for mentees.

**Requirements for the participation as a mentee:**
