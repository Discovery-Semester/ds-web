## Welcome

The Discovery Semester is a project in which refugees with an academic background can attend lectures at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich free of charge.
They (mentees) are accompanied by students from ETH ZÃ¼rich (mentors).
The program provides insights into student life and by attending lectures, one can get to know an ETH study program.
Besides this, diverse Discovery Semester events make it possible to establish valuable contacts and offer the opportunity to practice German language skills.
