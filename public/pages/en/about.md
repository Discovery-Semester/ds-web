## About us

We are a diverse organizing team of students, PhD students and former students of ETH Zurich.
We are passionately committed to the Discovery Semester.
We want to give refugees an insight to studying at the ETH and the opportunity to build connections with students.
Together with the mentors we accompany them in the study life, present academic and also professional perspectives and thus stand up for equal opportunities.
For this purpose, we have created the Discovery Semester.
We take care of organizing application procedures and registering mentees as listeners, finding and training mentors, organizing events, financing our project as well as networking with other organizations and much more!

Our team currently consists of the following motivated members:

> Amrita Singh-Morgan  
> Annina Wachter  
> Elena Robinson  
> Florian Pauschitz (Co-President)  
> Idil Bekler (Co-President)  
> Jasmin Nüssli  
> Karolina Utermann  
> Matthias Niederberger  
> Paola Contini  
> Simon Frei  
> Tobias Knötzsch  

**You want to get involved with refugees at ETH? Write us!**

**You want to support us, but don't have time? Support us with a donation!**  
We are all volunteers, however the auditor fees, events and some tiny administrative costs need to be covered.
Your support can make the difference, whether someone gets this opportunity for their future.
