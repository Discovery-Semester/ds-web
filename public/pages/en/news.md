Dear prospectives, friends and supporters

As some of you may have gathered the ETH administration has shut down financial support for the Discovery Semester in spring of 2019. This came after our team developed a novel concept over half a year that acted on criticisms by ETH. Following this we faced a need to raise the listener fees of around 5’000 CHF independently.

We managed to fund another semester with the generous support of Stiftung Mercator Schweiz but the project “Engagier Dich!” sadly ended. Since then we have not been able to secure funds for another semester.

Now we have decided to start a last ditch effort to reactivate the Discovery Semester for refugees and asylum seekers at ETH. In addition to applying with other foundations we also consider different approaches to fundraising such as e.g. crowdfunding. Because these options are uncharted waters to us there is much to learn.

If you have experience with similar projects or know institutions that we might turn to we are looking forward to hear from you.

Should you even consider becoming a part of our team that would be even merrier. Send us message and we will get in touch with you.

Your Discovery Semester Team
