  - Help with the mystudies platform and the selection of as well as enrolment for courses.
  - Help with thr orientation around the campus and the ETH facilities/services.
  - Integration into the student life.

#### Tasks and responsibilities of the mentor:

Mentors help mentees with all questions and concerns connected to studying at ETH. The key tasks of a mentor include:

- Helping mentees in finding their way around the campus and the ETH facilities/services.

- Integration of mentees into the student life (for example having lunch together, doing sports or meeting friends)

- Optional attendance of social events during the semester where all project participants are given the chance to get to know each other to foster exchange between mentees and students.

- Feedback and evaluation of the program during the semester as well as at the end.

- Feedback on the well-being and the progress of the mentee in the project.


#### Requirements for the mentoring program:

- Availability during the first week of the semester (ideally even the week before) to help the mentee choose her/his courses.

- About one to two hours of time and motivation per week to support the mentee with any questions or problems he/she encounters.

- Proactive communication with the mentee.

- You are open towards other cultures and enjoy interacting with different people.


At the moment we are not looking for mentors. We will update this page and send an entry in the VSETH newsletter when that changes. Meanwhile we are looking for new team members - [contact us](mailto:contact@discovery-semester.ch) if you are interested.
