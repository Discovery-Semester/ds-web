**You want to support a refugee in getting to know ETH?**

**What is the “Discovery Semester”?**

Refugees (mentees) can attend individual courses at ETH Zurich as listeners for one semester free of charge.

As a mentor, you can accompany a mentee from the same or a similar field of study together with another ETH Zurich student.
You will support your mentee with all questions and concerns about studying at ETH.
Your main tasks are:
- Support with the selection of lectures and the myStudies platform
- Help with orientation at ETH (campus, ETH facilities and services)
- Promote integration into student life (e.g. eating together, sports or social contacts)
- Participate in events where you can get to know other mentors and mentees 
- Provide assistance with mentees' questions 
- Give feedback about the program during and at the end of the semester
- Communicate with the organizational team regarding the mentee's well-being and their progress in the project

**Requirements for the participation as a mentor:**

- Enrollment at ETH Zurich
- 1-2 hours of time per week
- Availability during the first week of the semester (ideally also before) to help the mentee with course selection
- Participation in mentor training at the beginning of the semester.
- Proactive communication with the mentee
- Openness towards other cultures and enjoyment of exchange
