## Welcome

#### Are you interested in an academic education in Switzerland? Are you an asylum seeker and/or refugee? Then you've found the right project!

We offer interested persons a bridge to the Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich. Our program is aimed at people who fled to Switzerland and/or are seeking asylum here. In particular we provide insight into the student life, that is lectures, planning of ones studies and preparations as well as social events with other students, new experiences and support for study-related questions.

If our project appeals to you, click [here](/mentees) for more information.

#### A new perspective? Do you want to support a refugee in getting to know ETH and the student life?

The Discovery Semester is a project that enables refugees with an academic background to become listeners at ETH. They are supported by students (so-called mentors) who coach the refugees one-to-one. During the semester we offer a range of events to help integrate the refugees into student life at ETH and foster the exchange between them and students.

At the moment we are not looking for mentors. We will update this page and send an entry in the VSETH newsletter when that changes. Meanwhile we are looking for new team members - see below. 

#### Do you want to help shape our program (and make us fit for the future)?

We are looking for new members for the Discovery Semester organizational team! We are a VSETH-recognized organization that carries out events for the participants of the Discovery Semester. We plan the whole course including the application procedure, organization of events, management of public relations and communication with other student bodies.

If you would like to join the project and do some meaningful work while you study at ETH, [tell us](mailto:contact@discovery-semester.ch). We're looking forward to hearing from you!
